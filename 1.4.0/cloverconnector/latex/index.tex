Integrate your hardware and software with Clover’s hardware and software, making your point-\/of-\/sale E\+MV compliant quickly and easily. Clover’s secure semi-\/integration solution allows your existing point-\/of-\/sale software to accept E\+M\+V-\/ready, P\+C\+I-\/compliant payments, as part of a customer-\/facing experience that enhances the P\+OS and handles all payment acceptance tasks.

I\+S\+Vs can integrate with Clover Minis, Mobiles, and Stations and engage in a payments-\/as-\/a-\/service model. When you integrate with Clover, your point-\/of-\/sale can become E\+MV compliant quickly and easily. We currently offer integration with devices suited for brick-\/and-\/mortar locations, as well as a developer preview of mobile S\+DK libraries that work for B\+Y\+OD scenarios.

I\+S\+Vs who semi-\/integrate with third-\/party hardware will use our high-\/level S\+D\+Ks to send messages to and receive messages from a Clover device. Keep your merchants satisfied with the system they’re used to, and let us take the hassle of E\+MV compliance away from you. After integrating with us, the Clover device becomes a plug-\/and-\/play solution for your merchant base.

If you have an existing P\+OS with a strong merchant base and are looking for the fastest way to make that system E\+MV compliant, then this is probably the best option for you. Other scenarios where semi-\/integration is a good choice include\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily You} have a sophisticated system from which it is difficult to move away \item {\ttfamily You} have a strong brand with which your merchants identify \item {\ttfamily You} have a P\+OS system which requires specialized hardware $\ast$ \end{DoxyItemize}
