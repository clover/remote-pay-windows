/**
 * This example class illustrates how to connect to a clover device, process a sale and then refund the The dialog
 * which occurs is:
 *    1) Create CloverConnector based upon the specified configuration
 *    2) Register the CloverConnectorListener with the CloverConnector
 *    3) Initialize the CloverConnector via initializeConnection() method
 *      a) If network connection configured, input the pairing code provided by the device callback
 *    4) Handle onDeviceReady() callback from device indicating connection was made
 *    5) Create a SaleRequest consisting of an amount and a UNIQUE ID and call the sale() API method to request the
 *    device to begin processing the sale.  Depending on merchant settings, card used in the transaction, device
 *    configuration, etc, the device may prompt for
 *      a) Payment (including possible Credit/Debit selection)
 *      b) Signature
 *      c) Notify merchant signature verification (NOTE:  This is handled by the onVerifySignatureRequest() callback
 *      which is configured in this handler to automatically accept signature verification
 *      d) Receipt choice
 *      NOTE:  During sale processing, the device may challenge the transaction (double charge, offline payment, etc).
 *      The registered listener MUST handle the onConfirmPaymentRequest() callback.
 *    6) After all device prompts have completed, the onSaleResponse() callback is made by the device which
 *    provides the status of the sale request
 *    7) Based upon the provided payment information in the sale notification, produce a RefundRequest and call the
 *    refundPayment() API method to request a refund.  Depending on merchant settings, card used in the transaction, device
 *    configuration, etc, the device may prompt for
 *      a) Receipt choice
 *    8) Handle onRefundPaymentResponse() callback from device indicating refund was processed
