# Clover SDK for Windows PoS Integration

Current version: 0.5

## Overview

This SDK provides an API with which to allow your Windows-based Point-of-Sale (POS) system to interface with a CloverÂ® Mini device (https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/mini)

The API is currently distributed in three class libraries

1. CloverConnector is the high-level API with methods like `Sale()`, `VoidTransaction()`, `ManualRefund()`, etc.
2. CloverWindowsSDK contains classes that map to standard Clover objects such as `Payment`, `CardTransaction`, `Order`, etc.  These objects will match those defined in [clover-android-sdk](https://github.com/clover/clover-android-sdk) and the objects returned by the [Clover REST API](https://www.clover.com/api_docs)
3. CloverWindowsTransport contains functionality to interface with a Clover Mini device via USB or via LAN (WebSocket connection). You may also simulate a Clover device (`CloverTestDevice`) so no connectivity is required.

The libraries currently require .NET 4.0 or higher, and are supported on Windows POSReady 2009, Windows 7 and Windows 8.

An example project (CloverExamplePOS) is provided to demonstrate how to interact with the APIs.  To open this, please use Visual Studio and open `Clover.sln`

An installer is now available under the 'Releases' tab, which will automatically install the appropriate drivers needed to connect to Clover Mini.

Please report back to us any questions/comments/concerns.

## Release Notes

### Version 0.5
* Add VaultCard method which prompts for card information on the Clover device to be captured for later use with Sale/Auth VaultedCard functionality
* RefundResponse now supports `Code` attribute indicating whether response has been processed by device
* CaptureAuth method now fully supported

### Version 0.4
* Add CardEntryMethod to CloverConnector which allows customization of entry methods (contactless, EMV/contact, swipe, manual entry)
* Add a constructor to CloverConnector which takes a CloverDeviceConfiguration and a CloverConnectorListener
* Add AcceptSignature and RejectSignature methods to CloverConnector
* Add Cancel method to CloverConnector which should cancel the current card transaction whenever possible
* Add InvokeInputOption method to CloverConnector which allows the POS to control most screens on the device (excluding PIN entry)

* An installer ([CloverSDKSetup.exe](https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-windows/releases/download/release-0.5/CloverSDKSetup.exe)) is now available, which automatically installs appropriate USB drivers for Clover Mini; this has been tested on Windows 7 and above
* In addition to the .NET class libraries, there is now an option to connect to a WebSocket service or REST service (with socket callbacks) from the Windows PC.  This was added to provide better support for programming/integration environments other than .NET
* CloverExamplePOS application has been enhanced to allow testing with USB, LAN, REST service or WebSocket service, or an in-memory/mock 'test device'

### Version 0.3
* Add properties to CloverConnector: DisablePrinting, DisableCashBack, DisableTip, and DisableRestartTransactionOnFail
