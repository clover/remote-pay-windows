# Clover SDK for Windows POS Integration

Current version: 1.3.1

## Overview

This SDK provides an API with which to allow your Windows point-of-sale (POS) system to interface with a [CloverÂ® device](https://www.clover.com/pos-hardware/). Learn more about [integrations](https://www.clover.com/integrations).

**Supported Windows Versions:**
  * Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 7

The Windows project includes a .NET DLL, REST API Service, WebSocket API Service, and an example POS. There are three ways to connect to a device:
- CloverConnector.DLL can be used directly by a .NET application. Note: Requires .NET 4.0
- CloverConnectorRESTService provides a Windows service with a REST API and REST callbacks. To use this, the POS will have to implement a REST service to get callbacks from the service
- CloverConnectorWebSocketService provides a Windows service with a WebSocket endpoint. To use this, the POS will have to implement a WebSocket client to communicate with the WebSocketService and receive callbacks.

**To effectively work with the project you'll need:**
- A computer or virtual machine running Windows. The SDK supports Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 7.
- An IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

## Installers

There are four separate installers:
### For Development:
  * CloverSDKSetup.exe - Installer that will lay down the DLL, REST Clover Connector Service, or WebSocket Clover Connector Service, along with the optional example POS application and source for testing.

### For Deployment:
  * CloverUSBDriverSetup.exe - Clover device USB Driver installation only (automatically installed with the other installers)
  * CloverRESTServiceSetup.exe - Installer for the REST Clover Connector Service only
  * CloverWebSocketServiceSetup.exe - Installer for the WebSocket Clover Connector Service only

To experience a transaction end-to-end from the merchant and customer perspectives, we recommend getting a [Clover DevKit](http://cloverdevkit.com/collections/devkits/products/clover-mini-dev-kit).

## Release Notes
### Version 1.3.1
* Enhanced EventLog source creation methods to provide better message debugging.
* Added support for starting Custom Activities and handling messaging with those activities.
* Added example custom activity processing to the CloverExamplePOS application.
* Added Device Status messaging to provide better insight into the current state of the connected payment device.
* Added RetrievePayment request/response to provide the ability to query for a payment by external ID on the device.
* Added some new starter examples to aid in quickly getting connected to a Clover device for a few simple scenarios
that originally attempted to process said payment. Provides additional situational awareness after unexpected
disconnects with the payment device.
* Bug fixes for request validation handling.
* Updates for the Secure Network Pay Display support and configuration.
* General improvements to the Clover Example POS application.

### Version 1.2.1
* Additional logging for connector communication and selected transport
* Added USB Device Hardening via persistent service debug options
* Corrected a bug in the definition of one of the internal message classes. Customer API not impacted.

### Version 1.2.0
* PreAuthRequest - no longer prompts for signature or signature verification. Duplicate payment checking and print options can also be disabled if desired by setting the appropriate PreAuthRequest overrides of disablePrinting, disableDuplicateChecking & disableReceiptSelection to true.
* Changes to support certain transaction level overrides have been included in this version. To facilitate the addition of the new override capabilities, some new options were added to the SaleRequest and TransactionRequest classes.
  * TransactionRequest - extended by SaleRequest, AuthRequest, PreAuthRequest & ManualRefundRequest.
    * (Long) signatureThreshold was added to enable the override of the signature threshold in the Merchant settings for payments.
    * (DataEntryLocation) signatureEntryLocation was added to enable the override of the Signature Entry Location in the Merchant Signature Settings for Payments.  Value of NONE will cause the device to skip requesting a signature for the specified transaction.
    Possible values:
      * ON_SCREEN
      * ON_PAPER
      * NONE
    * (Boolean) disableReceiptSelection was added to enable bypassing the customer-facing receipt selection screen.
    * (Boolean) disableDuplicateChecking was added to enable bypassing any duplicate transaction logic and associated requests for confirmation.
    * (Boolean) autoAcceptPaymentConfirmations was added to enable the automatic acceptance of any payment confirmations that might be applicable for the given transaction (e.g. offline payment confirmation).  This override prevents any payment confirmation requests from being transmitted back to the calling program and continues processing as if a confirmPayment() was initiated by the caller.
    * (Boolean) autoAcceptSignature was added to enable the automatic acceptance of a signature (on screen or on paper) if applicable for the given transaction. This override prevents signature confirmation requests from being transmitted back to the calling program and continues processing as if a acceptSignature() was initiated by the caller.
  * SaleRequest (extends TransactionRequest).
    * (TipMode) tipMode was added to specify the location from which to accept the tip. You can now provide a tip up front or specify no tip to override the merchant configured (on screen/on paper) settings. **NOTE** If you desire to take the tip on paper, populate the signatureEntryLocation with ON_PAPER
    Possible values:
      * TIP_PROVIDED - tip is included in the request.
      * ON_SCREEN_BEFORE_PAYMENT - valid when requested via Mini or Mobile.
      * NO_TIP - tip will not be requested for this payment.
  * Corrected an issue with handling large messages resulting in USB communication failures to connected devices.

### Version 1.1.0.2
  * Fix issue where requiresRemoteConfirmation was false

### Version 1.1
* Renamed/Added/Removed a number of API operations and request/response objects to establish
  better consistency across platforms.

  * ICloverConnector (Operations)
    * Added
      * PrintImageFromURL
      * InitializeConnection **(REQUIRED)**
      * AddCloverConnectorListener
      * RemoveCloverConnectorListener
      * AcceptPayment - (REQUIRED) Takes a payment object - possible response to a ConfirmPaymentRequest
      * RejectPayment - (REQUIRED) Takes a payment object and the challenge that was associated with
                        the rejection - possible response to a ConfirmPaymentRequest
      * RetrievePendingPayments - retrieves a list of payments that were taken offline and are pending
                                  server submission/processing.
    * Renamed
      * CapturePreAuth - formerly captureAuth
      * ShowDisplayOrder - formerly displayOrder - this is now the only operation needed
        to display/change order information displayed on the mini
      * RemoveDisplayOrder - formerly displayOrderDelete
    * Removed
      * DisplayOrderLineItemAdded - ShowDisplayOrder now handles this
      * DisplayOrderLineItemRemoved - ShowDisplayOrder now handles this
      * DisplayOrderDiscountAdded - ShowDisplayOrder now handles this
      * DisplayOrderDiscountRemoved - ShowDisplayOrder now handles this
    * Modified
      * SaleRequest, AuthRequest, PreAuthRequest and ManualRefund require ExternalId to be set. (REQUIRED)
        * ExternalId should be unique per transaction allowing the Clover device to detect, and potentially reject, if the same externalID is reused for subsequent transaction requests
      * changed all device action API calls to return void
      * CloverConnecter now requires ApplicationId to be set via configuration/installation of the third party application. This is provided as part of the device configuration that is passed in during the creation of the CloverConnector.
      * Behavior change for RefundPaymentRequest. In the prior versions, a value of zero for the amount field would trigger a refund of the full payment amount. With the 1.0 version, passing zero in the amount field will trigger a validation failure. Use FullRefund:boolean to specify a full refund amount. NOTE: This will attempt to refund the original (full) payment amount, not the remaining amount, in a partial refund scenario.

        * Message:String optional detail information about the result value, if not success
      * SaleResponse, AuthResponse and PreAuthResponse have 3 new flags (e.g. The payment gateway may force an AuthRequest to a SaleRequest)
      * IsSale:boolean - true if the payment is closed
      * IsAuth:boolean - true if the payment can be tip adjusted before closeout
      * IsPreAuth:boolean - true if the payment needs to be "captured" before closeout will close it
* VoidPayment operation fix to verify connection status and check for void request
  acknowledgement from the Clover device prior to issuing a successful response
* Added DefaultCloverConnectorListener, which automatically accepts signature if a verify
  signature request is received
* Behavior change for RefundPaymentRequest - In the prior versions, a value of zero for
  the amount field would trigger a refund of the full payment amount. With the 1.1 version,
  passing zero in the amount field will trigger a validation failure.
  Set fullRefund:boolean to `true` to specify a full refund. NOTE: This will attempt to refund
  the original (full) payment amount, not the remaining amount, in a partial refund scenario.
* CloverConnecter now requires ApplicationId to be set via configuration of the
  third party application. This is provided as part of the device configuration
  that is passed in during the creation of the CloverConnector.  The String input parameter of
  "applicationId", which is passed in when instantiating the DefaultCloverDevice, should be
  set using the format of <company specific package>:<version> e.g. com.clover.ExamplePOS:1.2
* Modified remote pay so prompts to take orders offline and flagging duplicate orders appear only in merchant facing mode.
* Added ability to query pending payments.

    field would trigger a refund of the full payment amount.  With the 1.0 version, passing zero
    in the amount field will trigger a validation failure.  Use FullRefund:boolean to specify a
    full refund amount. NOTE: This will attempt to refund the original (full) payment amount,
    not the remaining amount, in a partial refund scenario.
  * CloverConnecter now requires ApplicationId to be set via configuration/installation of the third party application. This is provided as part of the device configuration that is passed in during the creation of the CloverConnector.
  * SaleRequest, AuthRequest, PreAuthRequest and ManualRefund require ExternalId to be set.
    * ExternalId should be unique per transaction request and will prevent the Clover device

* An installer ([CloverSDKSetup.exe](https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-windows/releases/download/release-0.5/CloverSDKSetup.exe)) is now available, which automatically installs appropriate USB drivers for Clover Mini; this has been tested on Windows 7 and above
* In addition to the .NET class libraries, there is now an option to connect to a WebSocket service or REST service (with socket callbacks) from the Windows PC.  This was added to provide better support for programming/integration environments other than .NET
* CloverExamplePOS application has been enhanced to allow testing with USB, REST service or WebSocket service, or an in-memory/mock 'test device'

### Version 0.3
* Add properties to CloverConnector: DisablePrinting, DisableCashBack, DisableTip, and DisableRestartTransactionOnFail

* Add switcher for CloverExamplePOS to switch between "test" configuration and USB configuration

### Version 0.1

* Initial release




## Getting Connected
1. Download the USB Pay Display app from the Clover App Market on your Clover Mini Dev Kit.
2. Open the USB Pay Display app
3. Run the Clover Connector Windows Example POS app on your Windows POS device
4. You should see the example POS screen and connection options listed based on the installed connectors. If everything worked you'll get a connected status. If it remains disconnected, you'll want to check that
   1) The Clover USB Device drivers are installed
   2) You are connecting the correct cable to the correct connection point on the Clover Mini âhubâ - port USB(port with Clover logo). You will need to use the USB cable that the device came with.

## Working with the SDK

  ```
      ICloverConnect cloverConnector = new CloverConnector(new USBCloverDeviceConfiguration("com.yourcompany.app:2.1.1", false));
      cloverConnector.addCloverConnectorListener(new YourListener(cloverConnector))
      cloverConnector.InitializeConnection();
      ...

	  class YourListener : DefaultCloverConnectorListener
	  {
	        public MyListener(ICloverConnector cc) : base(cc)
			{
			}

			public override void OnConfirmPaymentRequest(ConfirmPaymentRequest request)
            {
				// accepting by default... can pop a dialog or look at config properties to determine if the payment should be accepted or not
				// this will get called in at least 2 situations
				// 1. Detect possible duplicate payment
				// 2. Confirm offline payments if the merchant/Tx is configured to allow offline payments
                this.cloverConnector.AcceptPayment(request.Payment);
            }

			pubilc override void OnSaleResponse(SaleResponse response)
			{
			    if(response.Success)
				{
				    // payment was successful
					// do something with response.Payment
				}
				else
				{
				    // payment didn't complete, can look at response.Result, response.Reason for additional info
				}
			}

			// wait until this gets called to indicate the device
            // is ready to communicate before calling other methods
            public override void onDeviceReady(MerchantInfo merchantInfo)
		    {
                super.onDeviceReady(merchantInfo);
			    Start()
            }

            public void Start()
            {
                SaleRequest saleRequest = new SaleRequest(2215, "b1234"); // $22.15 with externalID "b1234"
                cloverConnector.sale(saleRequest);
            }
	  }

Building and running the Example POS application:

- .NET: using VisualStudio 2015:
 - open the Clover.sln, build all, select the CloverExamplePOS and run.

----VM SETUP-----
1. Install VMWare Fusion.  Virtual box does not see the device properly.
2. Run driver installers - see remote-pay-windows\windows-drivers\DriverPackages\Clover_Mini_Combined_Mode_WinUSB\InstallCloverMiniUSBDrivers.exe
-----END VM SETUP-----

-----DEBUGGING-----
```
To debug the device in tcpip:
Plug the device in to the laptop, select "Connect to Mac".
This sets the device up to be debugged on port 5555
>adb tcpip 5555
NOTE: if you get "error: more than one device and emulator" then you need to tell adb which device to set up explicitly.
List the devices:
>adb devices
List of devices attached
C010UC43040345	device
C030UQ50550081	device
Then explicitly tell adb which device to set up tcpip for:
>adb -s C030UQ50550081 tcpip 5555
This makes the device disconnect and reconnect, select "Connect to Windows".
You need to 'connect' to the device
>adb connect 192.168.1.3:5555
Now you can use 'adb logcat' or connect with the debugger via ip. For example:
>adb devices
List of devices attached
C010UC43040345	device
192.168.1.3:5555	device
```
-----END DEBUGGING----
