Clover SDK for Windows POS integration
======================================

Version
-------
Current version: 4.0.0

Overview
--------
This SDK enables your Windows point-of-sale (POS) system to communicate with a [Clover payment device](https://www.clover.com/pos-systems). Learn more about [Clover integrations](https://www.clover.com/integrations).

**Platforms supported:**
-   Windows 10
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 7

**.NET Frameworks supported:**
-   .NET 4.5
-   .NET 4.0 for backwards compatibility

Connecting to a Clover device
-----------------------------
The Clover SDK is provided as a set of .NET assembly releases and as C# sources. It can be used directly or adapted for hosting in translation layers as needed on Windows operating systems.

Clover devices (both production and DevKit devices) are connected to Microsoft Windows either by a USB connection or over the network. Clover USB drivers (found in the [releases page](https://github.com/clover/remote-pay-windows/releases)) are required for a USB connection.


To work with the project effectively, you will need:
-   A computer or virtual machine running Windows. The SDK supports Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 7.
-   An IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
-   To experience transactions end-to-end from the merchant and customer perspectives, we also recommend ordering a [Clover DevKit](https://cloverdevkit.com/collections/devkits/products/clover-mini-2nd-gen-developer-kit).

NuGet Package
-------------
Use NuGet references to easily include Remote Pay Windows in your .NET project
<https://www.nuget.org/packages/Clover.RemotePayWindows>
```
Install-Package Clover.RemotePayWindows -Version 4.0.0
```

Installing the SDK and Services
-------------------------------
There are two sets of binaries supplied, targeting different .NET Frameworks, the .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.0 backwards compatible.
-   The .NET 4.5 binaries are able to use TLS 1.2 network security when talking to Clover Devices using [Secure Network Pay Display](https://docs.clover.com/clover-platform/docs/pay-display-apps#section--secure-network-pay-display-).
-   The .NET 4.0 binaries are the same platform as the previous releases of the Clover Windows SDK, and are provided for backwards compatibility.

### For development:
-   CloverSDK.exe - This file will install the DLL. It will also install the example POS application and source for testing.

### For deployment:
-   CloverUSBDrivers.exe - This file installs the USB drivers for the Clover devices.

Building the SDK
----------------
The SDK has the following structure.
```
.
├── examples                           # Contains the C# Example application
│   └── CloverExamplePOS
│   └── exampleMessages
├── lib
│   └── CloverConnector                # CloverConnector module code
│   └── CloverWindowsSDK               # C# port of Clover Android SDK classes
│   └── CloverWindowsTransport         # Transport definitions (USB, WebSocket)
└── packages                           # Contains third-party dependencies
    └── lib
```

Working with the Example POS
----------------------------
